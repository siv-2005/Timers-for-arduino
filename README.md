This library is quite simple, but mandatory for my others libraries to work properly :)

First of all, you need to copy the TimersClk folder in your arduino libraries folder

  This library can be used to easily make time events

  Functions:
  
startTimers(); //it should be called in the loop for starting the timers

  For variables we have:
  
mstime => it makes an increment by 1 each milisecond (1s = 1.000 ms)

ustime => it makes an increment by 1 each microsecond ( 1s = 1.000.000 us)
