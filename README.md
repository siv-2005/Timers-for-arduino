First of all, you need to copy the TimersClk folder in your arduino libraries folder

  This library can be used to easily make time events

  Functions:
  
startTimers();

  It Should be called in the loop for starting the timers
  
  For variables we have:
  
mstime => it makes an increment by 1 each milisecond (1s = 1.000 ms)
ustime => it makes an increment by 1 each microsecond ( 1s = 1.000.000 us)
